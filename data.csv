By Dominic Chopping Equinor acquired a 9.8% stake in Danish wind energy producer Orsted as it looks to ramp up its exposure to renewable energy generation. It is developing the U.S. Empire Wind project offshore New York, has an interest in four Baltic Sea projects and operates a floating wind farm off the coast of Norway that helps power its offshore oil and gas rigs. Orsted has transformed itself in recent years from Denmark's small state oil company into a global giant in wind energy development, but last year hit major headwinds as it pushed aggressively to expand into new markets, particularly the U.S. The project should see 277 turbines producing enough electricity to power six million British homes.","Equinor Buys 9.8% Stake in Orsted as Part of Renewables Push — 2nd Update.

This transaction increases the Group’s interest in Lerta from 24.27% to a majority 56.75% equity stake. Photon Energy Group intends to acquire the remaining equity from the two founding shareholders before year-end 2022. The Group invested directly in Lerta for the first time in December 2020, leading the financing round with EUR 0.9 million for a 12% equity stake. Transaction Rationale Photon Energy Group’s core business covers the entire lifecycle of PV power plants, from project development and engineering, to procurement and construction as well as PV plant ownership as a market-oriented IPP (Independent Power Producer, all the way to the long-term operation and maintenance of proprietary and third party-owned power plants. Lerta manages a total capacity of almost 300 MWp, aggregated from more than 300 units across four countries. The deepening commercial cooperation between the Group and Lerta over the past two years, a shared vision regarding future trends in global energy markets and an ever more compelling strategic logic have led to Photon Energy Group’s decision to proceed with the transaction, aiming at the full integration of Lerta by year-end 2022. Energy generators will be able to benefit from an integrated approach to asset operation and management as well as cost-efficient market access, including balancing services. In October 2022 Lerta launched its energy supply business in Hungary and Poland, and intends to provide customers with clean electricity directly from local sources, including Photon Energy Group’s power plants. The Group’s strategic focus on selling the electricity generated by its 91.9 MWp proprietary portfolio at market prices, in combination with the growing market price volatility, regulatory dynamics and explosive growth in the demand for on-site generation solutions by commercial and industrial energy users, has crystallised the need for an expansion of the Group’s business model. Energy users will be able to manage and optimise their costs from a combination of on-site generation and off-site supply. In the first three quarters of 2022, Lerta generated consolidated revenues of EUR 19 million and expects full-year 2022 revenues of EUR 23 million.","Photon Energy Group Acquires Majority Stake in Lerta, Plans Full Takeover before Year-end 2022.

On October 7, Chevron Canada Ltd., an indirect subsidiary of Chevron, and a related entity announced that it would sell its 20% non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, 70% operated interest in the Duvernay shale, and related interests, all located in Alberta, Canada, to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. Chevron expects the US$6.5 billion deal to close in Q4 2024. In October, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with RWE to acquire a 50% stake in two offshore wind projects in the North Sea. It’s been over a year since Chevron announced its US$53 billion deal to acquire all the outstanding shares of Hess in an all-stock transaction. Chevron categorized the sale as part of its initiative to divest US$10 billion to US$15 billion in assets by 2028 to optimize its energy portfolio. Equinor made a splash in October when the Norwegian oil and gas and renewable energy company acquired 41,197,344 shares in Ørsted A/S , corresponding to 9.8% of the shares and votes in the company. In November 2023, BP announced its agreement to take full ownership of Lightsource BP, its solar power developer joint venture. Downward pressure from potential OPEC+ supply increases is being counteracted by upward momentum from falling interest rates in the United States and stimulus packages in China which could boost demand and help offset higher supply. BP said it intends to sell BP Wind Energy as an integrated business, with its workforce expected to transfer to the new owner on completion of a sale. In July 2021, Aker Clean Hydrogen and CapeOmega signed a MoU with AS Norske Shell to explore opportunities to develop the Aukra Hydrogen Hub to a large-scale production facility for clean hydrogen using natural gas from the local gas processing plant. The companies planned to produce blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen from natural gas using carbon capture and storage, and the transport that hydrogen via pipeline from Norway to Germany. Equinor hoped to produce green hydrogen from some of its offshore wind farms to help power industrial customers. The other stakeholders, ExxonMobil and CNOOC, filed arbitration claims against Chevron and Hess in an effort to block the deal. On September 16, BP announced it would divest its US onshore wind business to focus on onshore renewables in Lightsource BP. In January 2023, Equinor and German energy major, RWE, announced a partnership to develop large-scale value chains for low carbon hydrogen. The two discussed project disruptions shed light on the need for reliable and clear hydrogen policy and government funding from Germany and Norway to make hydrogen a worthwhile choice for energy majors looking to achieve their ESG goals. Hess holds a 30% non-operated interest in the coveted Stabroek block offshore Guyana. The Norwegian state has a controlling stake in Equinor. ExxonMobil completed its US$59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources  in May, which pole-vaulted the oil major to the largest producer in the Permian Basin. BP intends to launch the sale process shortly. CCS is the core focus of ExxonMobil’s Low Carbon Solutions division, which received a big boost when ExxonMobil bought Denbury for US$4.9 billion last year . However, Chevron got some much-needed good news from the Federal Trade Commission , which completed its antitrust review of the company’s merger with Hess. The new strategic direction marks a noticeable shift away from the ambitious climate targets BP unveiled in 2020.

Equinor produced 677 GWh from renewable assets in the third quarter, up 82 percent from the same quarter last year. The third tranche of the share buy-back programme was completed on 16 October 2024 with a total value of USD 1.6 billion. All share buy-back amounts include shares to be redeemed by the Norwegian state. The board has decided to initiate a fourth and final tranche of share buy-back for 2024 of up to USD 1.6 billion. This was due to high gas production from the Troll field and positive contributions from Aasta Hansteen and Oseberg. Based on this, the expected growth in power production from renewable assets in 2024 is adjusted to around 50 percent. Cash flow from operating activities before taxes paid and working capital items amounted to USD 9.23 billion for the third quarter. The board of directors has decided an ordinary cash dividend of USD 0.35 per share and an extraordinary cash dividend of USD 0.35 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Equinor delivered a total equity production of 1,984 mboe per day in the third quarter, down from 2,007 mboe in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income* was USD 2.19 billion, leading to adjusted earnings per share* of USD 0.79. Equinor paid one NCS tax instalment of USD 2.87 billion in the quarter and total capital expenditures were USD 3.14 billion. In the quarter, the Johan Sverdrup field delivered a production record of more than 756 000 barrels of oil in one day and reached the milestone of one billion barrels produced since the start-up five years ago. This has contributed to an all-time high production from the Troll field in the gas year. In the quarter, the world’s first commercial storage facility, Northern Lights, was completed and is now ready to receive CO2 from customers.” In the quarter, Troll B and C became partly powered from shore, contributing to the company’s efforts to strengthen competitiveness and halve operated emissions by 2030. In the UK, two key partner-operated low-carbon solution projects secured funding from the government. Equinor reported net operating income of USD 6.91 billion and net income at USD 2.29 billion.","Equinor produced 677 GWh from renewable assets in the third quarter, up 82 percent from the same quarter last year.

The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) is reviewing a petition for revised Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) targets for FY 2022-23. The proposed changes aim to align with national renewable energy goals and ensure sustainable power procurement in Gujarat. To comply with RPO, the company decided to purchase renewable energy from power exchanges under the Green Term-Ahead Market  and Green Day-Ahead Market  segments. The total capacity of these solar plants is 432 kW, and the energy generated from these plants is included in their RPO compliance calculation. The average market clearing prices in the power exchanges were significantly higher, making it unviable to purchase renewable energy through G-TAM/G-DAM segments consistently. The GIFT Power Company Limited , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gujarat International Finance Tec-city Company Limited , has submitted a petition to the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission  regarding its Renewable Purchase Obligation  compliance for the fiscal year 2022-23. However, GIFT PCL’s power purchase volume remains relatively low compared to other licensees, making it difficult to source renewable energy at competitive rates. During the fiscal year 2022-23, GIFT PCL attempted to purchase renewable energy at an approved rate of ₹4.50 per unit but faced high market prices and low trading volumes. The GERC has set specific targets for the procurement of power from renewable sources, including wind, solar, and other sources, for distribution licensees. The company has made several prayers to the GERC, including the admission of their petition for further processing, revision of RPO targets, exemption from RPO compliance for the fiscal year 2022-23, and allowance for future modifications to their application. The company seeks relief from the GERC to ensure that the RPO targets are realistic and achievable, given the current market conditions and external factors affecting power procurement.","The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) is reviewing a petition for revised Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) targets for FY 2022-23.

During the fourth year of the agreement, NextEra Energy Partners expects to exercise its right to buy out the Fund's equity interest for a fixed payment equal to $750 million, plus a fixed pre-tax return of 7.75 percent . NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc.  and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP , NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC  under certain specified conditions; Under the terms of the financing, the Fund will pay $750 million in exchange for an equity interest in the entity that will own the approximately 1,388-MW portfolio being acquired by NextEra Energy Partners. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; Provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable, which could decrease the value of NEP's common units, and could make it more difficult for NEP unitholders to change the board of directors; Supplier concentration at certain of NEP's projects may expose it to significant credit or performance risks; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from the Texas pipelines. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; Renewable energy procurement is subject to U.S. state regulations, with relatively irregular, infrequent and often competitive procurement windows; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Following the initial three-year period, if NextEra Energy Partners has not exercised its buyout right, the Fund's allocation of distributable cash flow from the portfolio would increase to 80 percent. CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less  a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, less  a pre-tax allocation of the earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits, less  debt service, less  maintenance capital, less  income tax payments, less  other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any. A valuation allowance may be required for NEP's deferred tax assets; Funds drawn under the credit facility are expected to be immediately repaid with a new $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing with a fund managed by BlackRock Global Energy & Power Infrastructure. NextEra Energy Partners has the right to pay at least 70 percent of the buyout amount in NextEra Energy Partners common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price, with the balance paid in cash. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; The Fund is expected to earn an effective coupon of approximately 2.5 percent over the initial three-year period, which represents the Fund's initial 15 percent allocation of distributable cash flow from the portfolio. Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected operating revenue plus the earnings impact from the amortization of convertible investment tax credits. The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.","NextEra Energy Partners, LP announces agreement to acquire approximately 1,388 megawatts of contracted renewables projects and enters into a $750 million convertible equity portfolio financing.
